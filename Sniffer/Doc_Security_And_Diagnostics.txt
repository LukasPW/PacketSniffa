Network Sniffer – Security & Diagnostic Features

Overview
--------
This tool is a passive network packet sniffer designed for educational
diagnostics and security observation. It analyzes packet metadata only
and does not inspect payload contents or decrypt traffic.

Privacy & Ethics
----------------
- No payload inspection
- No URL paths or content
- No user identification
- No traffic decryption
- Session-based logging only

Destination Labeling
-------------------
The sniffer classifies destination IPs with human-readable comments:
- MULTICAST (239.0.0.0/8): local service discovery (e.g., Spotify Connect, Bonjour)
- BROADCAST (255.255.255.255): local network broadcast
- PRIVATE LAN (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x–172.31.x.x, 192.168.x.x): local network
- All other IPs are resolved via DNS if possible

Example:
DEST=239.195.0.23 (MULTICAST: local service discovery)

Security-Oriented Features
--------------------------
1. Traffic Rate Monitoring
   Detects unusually high packet rates from a single IP.
2. SYN-Heavy Detection
   Identifies excessive TCP SYN packets without matching FIN packets.
3. Short-Lived Connection Churn
   Flags hosts that rapidly open and close many TCP connections.
4. Protocol Awareness
   Labels likely QUIC traffic (UDP/443) and tracks protocol distribution.
5. Destination Awareness
   Resolves destination IPs to hostnames or labels as multicast/broadcast/private.

End-of-Session Security Summary
-------------------------------
At shutdown, the tool prints a summary of observed anomalies using
neutral diagnostic language (e.g., "scan-like behavior observed").

Limitations
-----------
- Does not inspect encrypted traffic
- Does not track browsing activity
- Does not detect malware definitively
- Intended for diagnostics, learning, and ethical network analysis only
