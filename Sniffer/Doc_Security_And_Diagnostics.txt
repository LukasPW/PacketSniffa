Network Sniffer – Security & Diagnostic Features

Overview
--------
This tool is a passive network packet sniffer designed for educational
diagnostics and security observation. It analyzes packet metadata only
and does not inspect payload contents or decrypt traffic.

Privacy & Ethics
----------------
- No payload inspection
- No URL paths or content
- No user identification
- No traffic decryption
- Session-based logging only

Security-Oriented Features
--------------------------
1. Traffic Rate Monitoring
   Detects unusually high packet rates from a single IP,
   which may indicate misconfiguration, malware beaconing,
   or denial-of-service behavior.

2. SYN-Heavy Detection
   Identifies excessive TCP SYN packets without matching FIN packets,
   indicating scan-like or incomplete connection behavior.

3. Short-Lived Connection Churn
   Flags hosts that rapidly open and close many TCP connections,
   a common symptom of aggressive polling or faulty applications.

4. Protocol Awareness
   Labels likely QUIC traffic (UDP/443) and tracks protocol distribution
   to highlight unexpected protocol usage.

5. Destination Awareness
   Resolves destination IPs to hostnames using observed DNS responses.
   This reflects backend infrastructure rather than website branding.

End-of-Session Security Summary
-------------------------------
At shutdown, the tool prints a summary of observed anomalies using
neutral diagnostic language (e.g., "scan-like behavior observed").

Limitations
-----------
This tool does not:
- Detect malware definitively
- Inspect encrypted traffic
- Track browsing activity
- Perform intrusion prevention

The sniffer is intended for diagnostics, learning, and ethical network
analysis only.
