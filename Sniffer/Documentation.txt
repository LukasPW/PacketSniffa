TCP FLAGS – DIAGNOSTIC REFERENCE
(Project Documentation Copy)

SECTION 1: WHAT THIS SNIFFER ACTUALLY SEES

This program observes metadata only from network traffic.
It does NOT inspect payloads, URLs, page contents, or user data.

Captured fields typically include:

Source IP / Destination IP

Destination hostname (when DNS is visible)

TCP flags

Port numbers

Timestamp

Important limitation:

HTTPS encrypts application data

Websites like YouTube, Google, etc. appear as backend services,
CDNs, or load balancers rather than human-readable site names

Example:
DEST=minesweeperonline.com

DNS resolution succeeded

The hostname was visible before encryption

No page content or URL path is known

Example:
DEST=onedscolprdneu14.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com

Azure cloud backend

Likely a Microsoft service endpoint

The real application (e.g. OneDrive, telemetry, auth) cannot be
determined from TCP metadata alone

SECTION 2: HOW TO READ OUR LOG FLAGS

The FLAGS field describes the state of the TCP connection.

FLAGS=S

Connection attempt started

Client is asking: “Can I connect?”

FLAGS=SA

Server replied: “Yes, I’m here”

FLAGS=A

Connection is established

Data is acknowledged

FLAGS=PA

Encrypted application data is flowing

Normal during page loads

FLAGS=FA

Connection closed cleanly

Page or request finished successfully

FLAGS=R or RA

Connection rejected or forcefully closed

Often indicates blocked ports or denied services

Important:

Seeing FLAGS=S without follow-up often means:

Firewall blocking

Service not listening

Packet dropped

SECTION 3: WHY SOME SITES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED

Modern web traffic uses:

HTTPS

CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

Load balancers

Shared cloud infrastructure

Because of this:

A single website may contact dozens of backend servers

Hostnames may belong to cloud providers, not the site itself

URL paths are encrypted and never visible

This is expected behavior and not a flaw in the program.

SECTION 4: ETHICAL DESIGN DECISIONS

This project intentionally limits visibility to:

Connection existence

Network health

Diagnostic behavior

It avoids:

URL paths

Query strings

User identifiers

Content inspection

Reason:

Even partial URL tracking can expose private user behavior

Metadata-only logging is sufficient for diagnostics

Aligns with privacy-respecting network analysis practices

SECTION 5: REPORT APPENDIX (SHORT VERSION)

Appendix: TCP Flag Logging

The program logs TCP flags to diagnose connection behavior without
inspecting encrypted traffic. TCP flags indicate how connections are
established, maintained, and closed. This allows analysis of network
health and connectivity while preserving user privacy, as no payload
data or URLs are captured.
